# NeutronDiffusion2D
Solve a 2D Neutron scattering problem using finite elements on the Neutron diffusion equation

To get a basic idea of how the code works (and to experiment with parts of it), look in the
"NeutronDiffusion2D.ipynb" jupyter notebook. For the actual plots, I wrote up the code as a python function contained in the "neutrondiffusion.py" script.
"run_script.ipynb" contains  evaluations of the function that produce the plots which are contained in the folder "Plots".

The remaining files are not important and will likely be deleted later.
